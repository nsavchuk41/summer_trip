There will be our summaries! 


*Diana* :
During this practice work I learnt a lot of GitHub tools such as
collaboration with other people, making funny discussions , creating issues .
Also we merged issues to the milestones and we used special labels.
During our work we created few branches, sent pull requests and merge
branches into one (mater) branch. We used special “magic” words to 
close the issues (“resolve”, “close” ,  “fix”, etc. ) . 
We assigned to issues and learnt how to work with tables(“To do”, “In progress”, “Done” columns. ). 
We created a few projects (with automatization and without this). 
For the second one we made our manual settings for automatization.


*Nataly* :
During this practical task, I became familiar with many opportunities github,such as
collaboration with other people creating and solving issues.We also united the problems
in the milestones and appointed the responsible persons for more comfortable work on the project.
We also used colorful tags to make it easier to sort and filter issues.
In order to close issues we used "magic words" such as “resolve”, “close” ,  “fix”, etc.
We also created an automated project that worked with columns “To do”, “In progress”, “Done”.
(You can also add and create your own.)
We also created another project to set up automation on our own.
